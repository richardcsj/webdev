		<!-- there are 3 ways to style in CSS. First is Inline CSS. style within the tags-->
		
		<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%">Welcome to the CSS course!</p>
		
		<h1 style="color:green;font-size:250%">CSS is cool!</h1>
		
		<!-- the size is relative to the default paragraph size, 
		so if we want to make the h1 size 50% smaller, we need to make it 250%
		h1 is 2.5x bigger than p-->
		
		<!-- problem with inline: it goes inside the content
		not very nice to read and styling is specific to a paragraph,
		so it would be messy if i wanted to apply the same style for all paragraphs->>
