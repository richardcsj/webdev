3 algorithms for sorting: 

takes nsqr time: bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort

Selection sort:

Iteration 1:
1) search for the smallest item
2) swap with the first item (so the first element is sorted)

Iteration 2:
1)repeat the same process starting from the 2nd position in the array

Do this until the array is sorted
